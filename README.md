# mySecretNumber (Simple Guessing Game)

## Brief description

1. __"mySecretNumber"__ generates a random number between 1 and 2 (to 1 decimal point).
2. The game prompts users for their username (saved in cookie).
3. After each unsuccessful attempt the user is informed: 
    + that the entered number is greater or less than the hidden number
    + reminds the user of the range is guessing
4. At a correct guess, the game awards the player a point (also saved in cookie), and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1. (e.g range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on)
