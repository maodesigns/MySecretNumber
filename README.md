# MySecretNumber
Task Title: Functions/ Arrow Functions

A number guessing game that generates a number between the range of 1 and 2.

The game prompts users for their username (saved in cookie).

Range is set as a function parameter and prompts the player to predict the generated number between the given range.

At a correct guess, the game awards the player a point (also saved in cookie), and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1 (e.g range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on).
